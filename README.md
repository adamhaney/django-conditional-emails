DEPRECATED: I started this project as an attempt to scratch my own itch. 
That itch has since been scraped with django-drip which sends emails to
users based on a conditions system. I'm keeping this repo around for my 
own reference but I highly suggest using django-drip instead of this.

==================
Conditional Emails
==================

Very often when working on apps we want to send emails to users based
upon an administrator contigured 'trigger'. After they've achieved
some goal, been registered for a period of time etc. This app creates
and administrative interface for creating emails for sending such
emails and for testing those rules and previewing outgoing emails.
